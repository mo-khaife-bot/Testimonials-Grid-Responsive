## Overview

I used the style guide from the figma design of the Testimonial Grid pattern, then make it responsive for Desktop & Mobile.

| Mobile View                                     | Desktop View                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Mobile](./images/Testimonial-Grid-Mobile.png) | ![Desktop](./images/Testimonial-Grid-Desktop.png) |

<!-- | Mobile View                                     | Desktop View                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to utilise CSS Grid to make the layout.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.card--bg-gray-blue {
  background-color: var(--primary-grayish);
  color: #fff;
}

.card--bg-black-blue {
  background-color: var(--primary-blackish);
  color: #fff;
  grid-area: patrick;
}
.card:nth-of-type(5) {
  grid-area: kira;
}
}
```

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  gap: 30px;

  grid-template-areas:
    "daniel daniel jonathan kira"
    "jeanette patrick patrick kira";
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
}
```
